# CodeAlpha Simple E-commerce Store

This is an internship project where I developed a basic full-stack e-commerce platform.  
It allows users to browse products, apply filters, add items to a cart, and manage their selections.

The frontend is built with **React** and styled with **Bootstrap**, while the backend is powered by **Node.js** with **Express** and **MySQL** for persistent data storage.
